1. How do we get the locations of spilled stack slots for physical registers?
   - The register allocator generates a VirtRegMap which maps virtual registers
     to physical registers or spill slots.  However, it doesn't handle spilling
     physical registers around call sites.

2. How are vreg mappings to spill slots that are valid after the register
   allocator marked as dead objects when emitting stackmaps?

3. Detecting physical/virtual register mappings in SelectionDAGBuilder's
   "addStackMapLiveVars" is probably incomplete -- how do we handle
   non-CopyFromReg nodes?
