External scripts that are called:
- mlink_x86Objs.s -> implemented as the 'goldLink' method of 
  AbstractArchitecture
- mlink_armObjs.s -> same as above
- nmScript.sh -> TODO - wait, is this actually used?? --> yes
- readMyElfToFile.sh -> done, straightforward readElf() function in Utils 
  module
