NOTE: you *must* have musl & libELF built & installed for both architectures
for you can build libDWARF!  This guide expects musl & libELF to be installed
at: /usr/local/popcorn/<arch>

Once again, we need to build against musl-libc (to prevent glibc-specific
symbols from creeping into the binaries).  Additionally, you'll need to tell
autoconf where you installed libELF.  To build:

NOTE: do a "make distclean" in-between building for different architectures!
NOTE: "make install" is just a stub so we'll have to manually copy some files

AArch64 (you may need to supply your own cross-compiler via CC):
$ export CC=<AArch64 compiler> # Optional, default is "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc"
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -specs /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu
$ make
$ cp libdwarf.a /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib
$ cp dwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/include
$ cp libdwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/include

x86-64:
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -specs /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure
$ make
$ cp libdwarf.a /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib
$ cp dwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/include
$ cp libdwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/include
