Overview
--------

The libdwarf library is used to read DWARF debugging metadata generated by the
compiler, which contains variable location information and the register save
procedure for each function call frame.  DWARF metadata is used by the stack
transformation runtime to traverse a thread's stack -- the runtime can both
reverse or apply the register save procedure to go up an activation or down an
activation, respectively.  Optionally, DWARF metadata can be used to find
variable locations within a stack frame.

We use libdwarf unmodified, except for a couple of changes in the build
procedure to cross-compile for aarch64.
