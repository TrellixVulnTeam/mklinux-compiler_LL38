Installing libdwarf
-------------------

The libdwarf library is needed by the stack transformation runtime, and
therefore needs to be compiled for all architectures in the system.

NOTE: libdwarf is built against Popcorn's musl-libc and libelf.  Please install
these libraries for all architectures in /usr/local/popcorn/<arch> before
continuing -- it is important to compile against musl-libc, otherwise gcc will
default to compiling against glibc and glibc-specific symbols will creep into
the library.  This will lead to undefined/unresolved symbols when compiling
applications.

NOTE: do a "make distclean" in-between building for individual architectures

1. Build & install libdwarf for aarch64:

  $ CFLAGS="-O3 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -specs /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu
  $ make # Note: libdwarf has an install target, but it doesn't do anything
  $ cp libdwarf.a /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib
  $ cp dwarf.h libdwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/include

2. Build & install libdwarf for x86_64:

  $ make distclean
  $ CFLAGS="-O3 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -specs /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure
  $ make
  $ cp libdwarf.a /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib
  $ cp dwarf.h libdwarf.h /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/include

3. You can speed the build up by enabling parallel jobs:

  $ make -j<# of parallel jobs>
