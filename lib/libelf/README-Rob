NOTE: you *must* have musl built & installed for both architectures before you
can build libELF!  This guide expects musl to be installed at:
/usr/local/popcorn/<arch>

We need to build against musl-libc, otherwise glibc-specific symbols creep into
the binaries.  To build:

NOTE: do a "make distclean" in-between building for different architectures!

AArch64 (you may need to supply your own cross-compiler by setting CC):
$ export CC=<AArch64 compiler> # Optional, default is "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc"
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -specs /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu --prefix=/usr/local/popcorn/aarch64 --enable-elf64 --disable-shared --enable-extended-format
$ make
$ make install

x86-64:
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -specs /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/popcorn/x86_64 --enable-elf64 --disable-shared --enable-extended-format
$ make
$ make install

Then do a make & make install and the library's files should live in:
/usr/local/popcorn/<arch>
