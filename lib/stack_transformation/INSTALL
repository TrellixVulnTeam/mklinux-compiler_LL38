Installing libstack-transform
-----------------------------

The libstack-transform library is needed by all multi-ISA applications, and
therefore needs to be compiled for all architectures in the system.  The
Makefile handles this, however.

Note: libstack-transform is built againts Popcorn's musl-libc, libelf and
libdwarf.  Please install these libraries for all architectures in
/usr/local/popcorn/<arch> before continuing -- it is important to compile
against musl-libc, otherwise gcc will default to compiling against glibc and
glibc-specific symbols will creep into the library.  This will lead to
undefined/unresolved symbols when compiling applications.

1. Build & install libstack-transform for aarch64 & x86_64:

  $ make install

2. You can speed up the build by enabling parallel jobs:

  $ make -j<# of parallel jobs>

3. The library can be built in debug mode (no optimization, assertions & logging)
   as well:

  $ make type=debug install
  
4. There are a number of manually-configurable options in include/config.h.
   Below is a short list of the more important ones:

_TIMING: record how long it takes to perform individual stack transformation
         steps, e.g., time to unwind source stack, time to rewrite, etc.

_FINE_GRAINED_TIMING: more detailed timing information

_LIVE_VALS: select which type of live value location information to use for
            transforming frames.  DWARF_LIVE_VALS uses DWARF debugging
            information but is incomplete (gcc) or erroneous (LLVM) with
            optimizations enabled (anything above -O0).  STACKMAP_LIVE_VALS is
            the default and provides the most complete information, but
            requires running the STACK_INFO pass over the application's LLVM IR

_TLS_IMPL: select which thread-local storage implementation to use.
           COMPILER_TLS uses "__thread"-declared variables (which is not well
           supported by the alignment tool), while PTHREAD_TLS uses pthread
           keys to host storage.
