Implementation
--------------

1. How do we find pointers to the stack for pointers in arrays or structs?

2. Values should be 128-bits.

3. Handle variable-sized stack objects

4. Detect and handle when tail-call elimination only only happens on one
   architecture. Note: is this actually a problem?

5. Add constructor/destructor attributes to __st_userspace_ctr,
   __st_userspace_dtor & __st_destroy, make them static

------------
Optimization
------------

1. Instead of storing complete copy of register operations in each regset,
   store only a pointer (like C++ vtable)

2. Don't read FDE's CIE when getting FDE via PC
